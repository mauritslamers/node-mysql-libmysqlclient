Things to do or at least think about doing in the future


Synchronouse bindings
---------------------
  * Implement all methods of 'statement' class
  * Think over the names of methods, not much different
    from the original MySQL API functions, but with grouping,
    like for multiquery methods:
     * MultiMoreResults()
     * MultiNextResult()
     * MultiRealQuery()


Testing
-------
  * Write unittests for each function
  * Write functional tests for specific queries an situations


Documentation
-------------
  * Write doxygen comments for all source code
  * Write API documentation with descriptions for all public methods
  * Write some usable examples


Asynchrony
----------
  * Make a list of methods to be implemented in non-blocking version
  * Implement them to version 0.2.0
