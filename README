MySQL bindings for Node.js using libmysqlclient
===============================================

Documentation lives at http://wiki.github.com/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient/
and http://github.com/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient/tree/master/docs/.
The code lives at http://github.com/Sannis/node-mysql-libmysqlclient/.

The two files required to use these bindings are ./mysql-libmysqlclient.js and
./mysql_bindings.node(build/default/mysql_bindings.node).
Put this directory in your NODE_PATH or copy those two files where you need them.

Tested with Node version v0.1.97

== A small message for NodeJS community

Today this library supports all basic functions for working with MySQL.
In the near future, I plan to expand the list of methods
that can be invoked in an asynchronous NodeJS style.
I also postponed the implementation of prepared statements.

I will be happy to hear tips from the more experienced programmers.
If you are interested in wide MySQL usage in NodeJS applications,
leave your comments to the code.
Unfortunately not all methods are covered by unit and functional tests,
so I'll be glad to see your forks and commits in them :)

== Node.js

Node is the evented I/O for V8 javascript.
Node's goal is to provide an easy way to build scalable network programs,
it is similar in design to and influenced by systems like Ruby's Event Machine or Python's Twisted.
